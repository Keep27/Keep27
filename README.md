Hey! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Keep27**, a software developer from Zambia. I like to learn and build cool stuff with code.

Right now, I'm diving into Git, exploring web development, and figuring out how to turn ideas into reality. Every day is a new challenge, and I'm here for it.

**What I'm working with:**
- Git & GitHub
- Learning: C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Databases etc.
- Tools: VS Code, Git Bash, Postman, PostgreSQL

**Currently focused on:**
- Building my first projects
- Understanding version control
- Growing my GitHub presence

**Some things about me:**
- When I'm not coding: Gaming (online & PC), watching anime, reading manga, hitting the gym, building things, reading articles
- Favourite artists: OneRepublic, Twenty-One Pilots
- Favourite laptop: ThinkPad
- Based in Lusaka, Zambia

Still figuring things out, one commit at a time. Let's connect!
